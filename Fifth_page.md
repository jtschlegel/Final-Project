J.T. decided to attend the University of Missouri after hearing good things about it from his high school friends who were already there. Another big appeal for J.T. was that he could continue his rugby career here. J.T. decided to study environmental sciences at Mizzou because he was concerned with the effects that humans have on the environment.
