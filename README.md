  J.T. and John both attended Noonan Academy which is a private Catholic grade school. The school's website can be found [Here.](https://www.noonanacademy.org/)

# High School

  J.T. ventured outside of his comfort zone when it came time for him to select a high school. He took the entrance exam at Saint Ignatius College Prep and was accepted so he decided he would attend high school 25 miles away from where he grew up in the City of Chicago.

# College Years

J.T. decided to attend the University of Missouri after hearing good things about it from his high school friends who were already there. Another big appeal for J.T. was that he could continue his rugby career here. J.T. decided to study environmental sciences at Mizzou because he was concerned with the effects that humans have on the environment.
